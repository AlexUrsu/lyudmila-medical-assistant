📜 FULL CONVERSATION TRANSCRIPT:
----------------------------------------
🤖 Lyudmila: Let's go through your complaints in detail. Tell me about the first one: I feel constantly weak.. When did it start?
👤 You: It's hard to say, it kind of developed gradually over several years.
🤖 Lyudmila: Okay, a gradual development. How often do you experience this feeling of weakness these days? Is it constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?

👤 You: It is constantly present.
🤖 Lyudmila: I understand. And what seems to trigger or worsen the feeling of weakness? Are there certain activities or situations that make it more intense?

👤 You: I think it's related to my mood. When it gets worse, I clearly lose energy.
🤖 Lyudmila: Okay, so your mood plays a role in how you feel weak. Could you describe what kind of "bad mood" we are talking about? Is it sadness, frustration, or something else? And when does this happen? Is there a specific time of day, situation or event that makes the bad mood more intense and contributes to feeling weak?

👤 You: It's more like sadness and a feeling of inner emptiness. I feel a heaviness on my chest, as if someone had placed a stone slab there. Some days it gets better, but overall it's been consistently depressed for the last year.
🤖 Lyudmila: I see. So you describe your mood as persistent sadness with feelings of emptiness and a physical sensation like a heavy weight in your chest, which is likely related to depression that has lasted for about a year now.

Now, let's move on to the second complaint: It's hard for me to force myself to start doing anything. Can you give me more details about when this started? Was it gradual or sudden? And how does this affect your daily life?

👤 You: It happened just as gradually: at first I was just too lazy to do certain things, then procrastination began, which has now reached a practically total scale.
🤖 Lyudmila: Okay, so you feel like you lack the motivation to start any activities, and it's become increasingly difficult over time. Can you give me some examples of what tasks or activities are particularly hard for you to begin? And how does this affect your ability to complete everyday things? Is there anything that can help you get started, even a little bit?

👤 You: I have a hard time getting myself to wash and shave, and I have a hard time getting ready for work. The only thing that comes without effort is video games.
🤖 Lyudmila: Okay, so it seems like the difficulty in starting tasks is primarily related to your mood and possibly some level of depression or low energy. The fact that you find motivation in video games suggests there might be something enjoyable about those activities, even if they don't provide a lasting sense of accomplishment.

Now let's talk about the third complaint: I'm in a bad mood. You mentioned this is related to your feelings of sadness and emptiness. Can you elaborate on what contributes to these feelings? Are there any specific events or situations that trigger them, or are they more general and persistent? And does anything help to improve your mood?

👤 You: Before this event, someone close to me died. Perhaps the emptiness and loneliness gradually began to poison my soul.
🤖 Lyudmila: I understand. So you're feeling sad because of the loss of a loved one. The grief and sense of loneliness likely contribute to these feelings. And is there anything specific that makes your mood worse? Is it certain thoughts, memories, or situations that trigger sadness?

And what helps improve your mood? Are there any activities, people, or things you find comforting or uplifting?

👤 You: Thoughts about the past are depressing, and I still haven't let go of that situation. Distracting myself with video games helps.
🤖 Lyudmila: Okay, so dwelling on the past contributes to your sadness, and video games provide temporary relief. Is there anything else you do to cope with these feelings? Anything at all? Are there any coping mechanisms that help you manage these negative emotions? Also, have you tried any self-treatment for this weakness or bad mood?

👤 You: No, but I decided to seek help from a doctor and am now having a preliminary conversation with you.
🤖 Lyudmila: Okay, thank you for sharing all of this information. It helps me understand your situation better. Now that we've covered the main complaints, let's summarize:

*   **Constant Weakness:** Develops gradually over years, worsened by bad mood.
*   **Difficulty Starting Things:** Related to lack of motivation and potentially depression, exacerbated by sadness and emptiness.
*   **Bad Mood/Depression:** Triggered by grief from the loss of a loved one, with thoughts about the past contributing to negativity; video games provide temporary relief.

I've gathered all the necessary information and will pass it to your doctor. Thank you for your cooperation.
